My Lua code for reimplementing Collobert and Weston's "NLP from Scatch" paper. Adding them here since I've been getting many requests for the code.

Update: Many people have asked about the format of the data files used with this code. The data used is the WSJ data released by LDC, so you'll have to get it from there, but I've added a file called transform_to_features.pl that takes the WSJ data and creates the data files that my Lua code expects.
