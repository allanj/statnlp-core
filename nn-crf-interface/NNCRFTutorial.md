## StatNLP Feature Value Provider Interface

This document describe how to integrate the feature value provider into usual StatNLP implementations. In some of the implementation, you may want to use continuous feature value instead of binary feature value, or a neural network component such as Long short-term memory (LSTM) to improve the model performance. We will go through the procedure step by step based on previous StatNLP implementations. 

In general, we have two main feature value provider:
1. [Continuous feature value provider](#continuous)
2. Neural network feature value provider
